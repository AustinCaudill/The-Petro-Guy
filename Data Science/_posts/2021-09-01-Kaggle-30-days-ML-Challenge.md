excerpt: "ðŸŽ†Top 25% ðŸŽ†
30 days ago on a whim, I decided to register for a '30 Days of Machine Learning' competition having absolutely no experience in Machine Learning and very little experience with #Python.

Well, the competition closed yesterday and I just barely eeked by in the top 25% of the rankings out of over 7500+ submissions!"
