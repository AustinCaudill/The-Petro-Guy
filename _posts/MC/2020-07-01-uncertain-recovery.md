title:  "The Certainty About An Uncertain Recovery"
date:   2020-07-01
excerpt: "Newspapers, prime-time network newscasts, internet articles, and even random online conspiracists have all been making predictions since this pandemic first began: Would we enter a recession or depression, experience a 'V-shaped' recovery, or would life ever return to 'normal' at all? Those are the questions we have all been faced with over the past few months. "
