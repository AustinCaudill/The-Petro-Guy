excerpt: "38 years of dry-holes before the State of Florida offered a $50,000 bounty in 1939 for the state's first oil discovery.

Finally, in 1943 Humble Oil and Refining Co (now ExxonMobil) completed the Sunniland No. 1 and was awarded the bounty. The well came in at 140 bopd and quickly settled at 20 bopd."
